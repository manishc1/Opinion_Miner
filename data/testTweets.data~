There are no two ways about it: The Great Gatsby is misconceived and misjudged, a crude burlesque on what's probably American literature's most precious jewel.,
The central problem with Luhrmann's film is that when it's entertaining it's not Gatsby, and when it's Gatsby it's not entertaining.,
The best attempt yet to capture the essence of the novel.,
A failure that should have at least been a magnificent mistake.,
"The Great Gatsby" is a cool movie, in both the positive and negative sense. You may certainly be impressed, but you may not be moved.,
